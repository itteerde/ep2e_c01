Nice. You're setting up a classic slow-burn bootstrap op—very Eclipse Phase. Here's a plan structured around your parameters, aimed at going from low-profile survival to full ambush capability, while staying below the radar of a heavily armed enemy force. Your assets:

- **Breadcrumb System + Radio Booster** for long-distance Mesh connection.
- **Protean Swarm** for fabricating infrastructure, including a **Large Fabber**.
- **Infomorph on external server**, writing **48 blueprints in parallel**.
- **Timeframe: ~2 months until ambush**, giving you breathing room to scale up.

---

## ✦ PHASE 1: Initial Infrastructure Setup (Week 1–2)

**Goal**: Establish basic fabrication capability and resource extraction, while maintaining stealth.

### Step 1: Swarm Deployment
- Use the **Protean Swarm** to construct:
  - **Habitat Shell** (basic shielding + concealment)
  - **Power Source** (solar, geothermal, or scavenged reactor)
  - **Initial Fabber** (basic fabber to bootstrap parts for the Large one)
  - **Resource Harvesters** (extracting metals, organics, etc., from local environment)

> ✅ Key Blueprint Requirements:
- Low-profile structure modules
- Swarm-compatible large-fabber components
- Basic power systems
- Matter storage units

> 🧠 Blueprint Time: ~1 day for infrastructure set, with Infomorph multitasking

---

## ✦ PHASE 2: Large Fabber & Production Ramp (Week 2–4)

**Goal**: Assemble a full-scale Large Fabber to start serious gear production.

### Step 2: Build Large Fabber
- Protean Swarm and initial fabber produce parts
- Prioritize stealth fabrication (underground/hidden bay)
- Include repair drones and maintenance bots

> ✅ Blueprints Needed:
- Advanced fabber parts (heavy manipulators, nanoscopic printheads)
- Materials refinement units (to upcycle low-quality scavenge)

### Step 3: Resource Banking
- Harvest/store surplus rare metals, synthetics, etc.
- Start low-level production of baseline gear: weapons parts, armor plating, drone chassis

---

## ✦ PHASE 3: Tactical Asset Fabrication (Week 4–6)

**Goal**: Begin manufacturing ambush equipment, sensors, decoys, and weapons.

### Step 4: Defense and Camouflage
- EM masking, thermal insulation for fabber and base
- Deploy **decoy signals** or fake Mesh activity to throw off enemy scent

### Step 5: Build Core Equipment
- Combat drones (autonomous and remotes)
- Smart mines
- Mobile turrets
- Camouflage cloaks
- Portable EMP or jammers
- Sniper gear and long-range optics

> 🔧 Infomorph Blueprint Priorities:
- Custom weapon mods
- Compact armor systems (e.g., morph armor inserts)
- Disposable but high-impact tools (e.g., one-shot railgun turrets, spike launchers)

---

## ✦ PHASE 4: Morph and Cyberwar Suite (Week 6–8)

**Goal**: Prepare for infowar and ambush morphs optimized for terrain and tactics.

### Step 6: Morph Preparation
- Build specialized morphs (ghosts, furies, etc.) with appropriate mods:
  - Thermal masking
  - Chameleon skin
  - Enhanced reflexes or cybercombat modules

### Step 7: Infowar Assets
- Construct localized mesh network (secure mesh inserts)
- Deploy **sensor beacons** and **AI recon drones**
- Create **scramblers and counter-AIs** to neutralize enemy bots

---

## ✦ PHASE 5: Final Prep and Trap Setup (Last 1–2 weeks)

**Goal**: Set the bait, deploy traps, and stay hidden until trigger.

### Step 8: Site Fortification
- Booby trap approach vectors
- Set drones in pre-programmed ambush positions
- Create fallback positions and panic shelters

### Step 9: False Intel & Lure
- Leak fake Mesh signals or breadcrumbs leading to “vulnerable” positions
- Use infowar AIs to spoof presence and delay detection

---

## ✦ OPTIONAL: Psychological Ops

- If the enemy is vulnerable to psi, consider **constructing Async-enhanced morphs** (risky but high-reward).
- Use voice simulation and AR illusions to create panic or confusion.

Need help picking specific blueprint items (like "smart mine" stats or drone loadouts)? Or terrain-based tactics based on location (exo-planet, Titan, lunar cave, etc.)? Just say the word.

> Yes, make suggestions. The habitat is Extropia, a very large asteroid (10 million population), but still micro gravity. The ambush will be in an isolated mining tunnels section the group can prepare/modify with all the resources produced beyond the bootstrapping, all Blueprints available through writing them in Accelerated Time in parallel.

Perfect—Extropia changes the dynamic a lot. You're in a **high-density, surveillance-savvy, post-scarcity libertarian habitat** with **microgravity**, and **autonomy is expected** but **privacy is weaponized**. You’ve got **deep tunnels** for prep, **full access to blueprints**, and **up to two months to build** your ambush into a labyrinth. That’s a *goldmine* for trap design and asymmetric warfare.

Here are **tailored suggestions** for traps, drones, morphs, and tactics for your ambush—optimized for:

- **Microgravity**
- **Urban tunnel terrain**
- **Powerful enemy with milspec gear**
- **Surveillance-averse, liberty-tolerant society (Extropia)**

## 🔧 Key Manufacturing Suggestions

### 🔹 **Ambush Environment Mods**
1. **Modular Tunnel Sections** (Swarm-assembled):
   - Retractable panels with pop-out turrets
   - False walls or doors that open into vac chambers
   - Sections with magnetic locking plates to trap metallic armor
2. **Gravity Distortion Zones** (local field generators):
   - Use micrograv familiarity to your advantage—unexpected inertia kills fast.
   - Invert approach paths using burst-pulse grav projectors to slam enemies into ceilings/walls.
3. **Collapsing Sections or Trap Doors**
   - Drop attackers into sealed kill-boxes or cut them off.

> *All of this can be deployed as prefab modules using the protean swarm and drones.*

---

### 🔹 **Trap & Weapon Systems**

#### 1. **Smart Mines (Microgravity-Optimized)**
- Hover until triggered (using airburst grav pulse or magnetic lock)
- Sticky detonation for armored targets
- Variants:
  - EMP burst (vs bots/gear)
  - Fragmentation (tunnel ricochet bonus)
  - Monowire net traps

#### 2. **Turret & Drone Deployment**
- **Wall-crawling mini-turrets**: fold into panels; deploy when enemy passes
- **Microdrone Swarms**: mosquito-sized recon or neural-stunners
- **Scorcher Drones**: one-use plasma bursters that cook entire tunnels

#### 3. **Morph-Disabling Tools**
- **Tachyon Snare Fields** (impairs AR overlays and wireless sensors)
- **Pulse Disruptors** (scrambles AR HUDs/targeting systems)
- **Nanobinder Gas**: non-lethal, locks up exposed actuators and joints

---

### 🔹 **Combat Morphs for the Cell**

#### 1. **Ghost (Stealth Operative)**
- Chameleon Skin, Magnetic System, Reflex Boosters
- Pneumatic needler or monofilament whip for tight-space kills
- AR cloak overlays to blend into tunnel decor

#### 2. **Remade (Frontliner / Bait)**
- Hardened against kinetic/energy attacks
- Muscle Augmentation, Enhanced Respiration, Pain Filter
- Mountable shield plates for breaching or absorbing turret fire

#### 3. **Flexbot Modular Units**
- Adapt on-the-fly: switch from recon to assault to sabotage config
- Deployable limbs for extra fire arcs in tight tunnels

---

### 🔹 **Infowar & Surveillance Countermeasures**

#### 1. **Ghost Mesh Network**
- Local-only, peer-to-peer, impossible to hack from global Mesh
- Relay system using optical burst instead of EM

#### 2. **False Presence Generators**
- Project fake Mesh pings or morph biometrics (AI-controlled)
- Lure enemy into thinking cell is elsewhere or fractured

#### 3. **Drone Mimics**
- Cheap bots projecting fake signatures
- Some could simulate combat (explosive feedback, fake gunshots)

---

### 🔹 **PsyOps and Delays**

#### 1. **Mimic Your Pursuers**
- Clone enemy IDs or broadcasts to create false conflict between them
- Insert edited footage into Mesh to destabilize their cohesion

#### 2. **Non-Lethal Maze Zones**
- AR projectors to simulate morphs or obstacles
- Sleep gas or isolation nanodust zones—buys time, sows fear

#### 3. **“Dead Zones”**
- Absolute silence zones (no Mesh, no light, no sound)
- Infowar AIs mimicking stalker-like behavior—induce paranoia

## 🧠 Parallel Blueprint Queue Suggestion

With your 48-threaded Infomorph, stagger blueprint production like this:

| Group | Blueprint Set |
|-------|----------------|
| A (8 threads) | Smart Mines Variants (EMP, monowire, frag, adhesive) |
| B (8) | Modular tunnel trap systems (collapsibles, rotating segments) |
| C (8) | Autonomous Drones (scorchers, microrecon, repair bots) |
| D (8) | Combat Morphs and enhancements (ghosts, remade, async-compatible) |
| E (8) | Infowar gear (false ID modules, AR disruptors, dummy networks) |
| F (8) | Power sources, environmental mods, failover systems |

> 🎯 Use any spare cycles to tweak behavior trees and recognition protocols for smart traps, drones, and AI defense.

---

## ⚔️ Final Tactic: *"Break the Stack, Not the Shell"*

When the ambush hits:
- Focus on **disabling morphs and containment**, not killing outright—let their stacks sit in blackout until the op ends.
- A stacked-up foe can't warn allies.
- You can extract and interrogate later, or leave the cortical stacks behind as a warning.
